# Convoy Doctrine

**A field-ready approach to flashlights.**  
This project isn't about lumen charts or fence beamshots — it's about purpose-built light setups, matched emitters, drivers, and batteries, and the *doctrine* behind how they're used.

## What Is Convoy Doctrine?

**Convoy Doctrine** is a systems-based framework for using Convoy flashlights — and similar host lights — the way you'd field tools, not collectibles.

Instead of reviewing lights as isolated products, each write-up covers:

-  **Role-based configuration** (EDC, Tactical, Utility, etc.)
-  **Behavioral philosophy** (memory mode, clicky style, UI logic)
-  **Battery pairings** based on performance intent
-  **Recommended mode groups, drivers, and emitters**
-  **Host recommendations** for MCPCB compatibility, thermal profile, and beam goals
