## 🎯 Purpose & Design Intent

Compact high-CRI EDC with excellent color rendering and a cozy beam profile. The **3500K B35AM** provides warm, inviting light without going full candle-mode.

**Use cases:**
- Low-temp flood for evening tasks, close-up work
- Casual outdoor carry without harsh output
- Tint-snob friendly EDC for mood & accuracy

Aesthetics matter: **Tan host + black accents = smooth vibe**  
Size matters: **18350 = low weight, high agility**

## 🧪 Planned Tests
| Test | Goal |
|------|------|
| 20° bead TIR | Assess beam width & softness |
| Mule config | Maximize output, evaluate beam quality |
| OP reflector | Check for smoother spill, reduced artifacts |
| Thermal test | Observe runtime/heat curve on H16 |
| Tailcap current | Measure real draw with both cells |
| Beamshots | Compare all 3 configs + match tint vs 519A |
