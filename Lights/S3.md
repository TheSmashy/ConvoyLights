#  Convoy S3 – 519A 5000K – 3V 5A Linear  

**Role:** EDC  
**Use Case Summary:**  

The S3 is an upgraded version of the S2+, with shelf construction and better thermal handeling.  The 519A is not the most efficient emitter, but has very high CRI and at 5000K is excellent for EDC tasks like inspections, navigating dark rooms, and spotting within 50m.

##  Doctrine Notes

- This is an easy light to operate, with a moonlight mode as well as a useful 3% and 30%
- Rides easy in a pocket, quick to deploy.  Spare cells kept in EVA case in work bag.
- Good out to 50m, pair with an S6 or M1 for extended range.

##  Mod Notes / Assembly

- Only mod is a ReyLight titanium clip, which is well earned.

##  Output and Runtime  

| Mode  | % Output | Estimated Lumens | Est. Current Draw | Est. Runtime     |
|-------|----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Moon  | 0.1%     | ~1 lm            | ~0.005 A          | ~220 hours       |
| Low   | 3%       | ~30 lm           | ~0.07 A           | ~15 hours        |
| Med   | 30%      | ~300 lm          | ~0.75 A           | ~1.4 hours       |
| High  | 100%     | ~900–1000 lm     | ~4.5–5 A          | ~12–15 minutes¹  |

> ¹ **Note:** At 100%, expect thermal stepdown or aggressive heat buildup within 2–4 minutes in an enclosed space. Actual sustained output may settle between 500–600 lm depending on thermal throttling.

##  Beam Behavior

> “Big hotspot with usable flood”  
> “Good for clearing rooms, stairways, and vehicles”  
> "Moonlight is useful for checking gear, moving without blowing out nightvision, and discrete signaling"
