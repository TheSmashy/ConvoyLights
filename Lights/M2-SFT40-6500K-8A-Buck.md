# Convoy M2 with SFT40 (6500K, 8A Buck Driver) — Real Talk

This light lives in the sweet spot between punch and portability. It doesn’t have the M21B’s massive reflector or thermal mass, so don’t expect marathon runtimes at full throttle. But it’s chunkier than the M1, and with a Samsung 25R cell inside, it packs a serious punch.

I run it in **mode group 5** — just 1%, 20%, and 100% — with a forward clicky that makes hitting max output effortless. The beam has a wider hotspot and more spill than the M21B, so it’s less of a sniper and more of a “get the whole scene” type light.

Heat is something to watch here. Thanks to thermal paste pulling warmth from the head to the tube, the heat is noticeable fast, and you can definitely feel it in your hand after extended full-power use. For close-quarters or shorter stints, it’s fantastic. For long-distance or all-night use, I’d opt for the M21B.

## Mode Group 5 (Custom)

| Level  | Output (Lumens) | Runtime Estimate          |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 1%     | ~20 lm          | Longest runtime, battery saver |
| 20%    | ~400 lm         | Balanced output/runtime   |
| 100%   | ~1500 lm        | Short runtime, high heat |

*Note:* Heat builds quickly at 100%, thanks to thermal paste conducting heat to the tube. Hand becomes warm with sustained use.

This setup strikes a great balance for EDC or “heavy backup” when you expect trouble — punchy, pocketable, and with enough spill to light a wide area.
