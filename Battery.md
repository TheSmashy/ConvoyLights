## 📦 Cell Overview Table

| Cell Type | Capacity Range | Voltage | Max Discharge | Used In |
|-----------|----------------|---------|----------------|---------|
| 14500     | ~900–1100 mAh  | 3.6–3.7V | 5–10A           | EDC, first aid kits, compact utility lights |
| 18350     | ~1100–1400 mAh | 3.6–3.7V | 10–15A          | EDC, pocket rockets, short-burst tactical |
| 18650     | ~2500–3500 mAh | 3.6–3.7V | 10–20A          | General lights, power banks, chargers |
| 21700     | ~4000–5000 mAh | 3.6–3.7V | 15–45A          | Tactical lights, sustained output, multi-emitter lights |

##  14500 Cells

### Mission Role
- **Small form factor** for compact lights in medical kits or EDC roles.
- Ideal for **high-CRI emergency area lights** or first-aid deployment.
- Used in **Pokelit, AA/14500 hybrids**, or compact backup tools.

### Standard Cells
- **Vapcell F12** – High-drain, solid capacity, good for most AA lights. 3A 1250 mAh.
- **Vapcell H10** – Extra high drain, for pocket throwers.  10A 1000 mAh.  
- **Acebeam USB 14500** – Built-in charging, used where weight and rechargeability matter.

### Backup Cells
- **Energizer L91 (LiFeS2)** – Primary lithium; good shelf life, cold-resistant, no recharge.
- Stored alongside rechargeables in 4x cases for redundancy.

### Field Notes
- Button tops preferred for compatibility.
- Used where **lightweight + high reliability** are essential.

## 18350 Cells

### Mission Role
- **Short burst tactical output** in compact body.
- Perfect for **S2/S6/S3 builds**, EDC lights, copper/titanium showpieces, or hotrod lights.
- 18350 = **compact firepower**.

### Standard Cells
- **Vapcell H16** – High current with decent capacity. 5A 1600 mAh.  
- **Vapcell M11 v2** – Cooler running, works well in 5A+ buck driver lights. Performs on par with 30Q. 10A 1100 mAh.
- **Vapcell A11** - Less puncy than the M11 v2, good for 5A linear lights.  10A 1100 mAh.  

### Backup Cells
- None typically fielded separately. Carry spare in **padded EVA case**.

### Field Notes
- Runtime limited (~40 minutes on 100%).
- **Used deliberately** for fast missions: patrols, checks, deterrents.

## 18650 Cells

### Mission Role
- The **baseline power cell**.
- Compatible with most lights, used for **area lighting, tactical, utility lights**.

### Standard Cells
- **Samsung 30Q** – Well-rounded, moderate drain and good capacity.  15A 3000 mAh.  
- **Molicel M35A** – Cooler running alternative for buck/boost lights, better thermal performance.  10A 3500 mAh.  

### Backup Cells
- Stored in 4x cases (2x hot, 2x storage charge).
- Balanced across high-drain and capacity-first.

### Field Notes
- Good mix of **versatility, availability, and power**.
- Charger (XTAR VC4SL) set to store unused cells at 3.75–3.8V.

## 21700 Cells

### Mission Role
- **High capacity & high current** for mission-critical or multi-emitter lights.
- Used in **M21B, S21D, S12, S16, high-output tactical or sustained lights**.

### Standard Cells
- **Molicel P45B** – Gold standard for both current and capacity. Low voltage sag, high thermal ceiling.
- Used in all lights where 21700 is an option to **standardize**.

### Backup Cells
- Spares stored fully charged or at storage voltage in padded hard case.
- One extra cell always travels with M21B/S21D deployments.

### Field Notes
- **No need to stock alternatives**—P45B is the solution.
- Always charge/discharge in ventilated space; these can dump serious current.

## Supporting Gear

### Chargers
- **XTAR VC4SL** – Storage mode, internal resistance reading, USB-C PD input.
- **XTAR VC2SL** – Travel unit, fast USB-C charging.

### Storage
- Silica packs in all cases.
- **Cell condition check every 90 days** via calendar reminder.

### Maintenance Cycle
- Run “Check Cells” protocol:
  - Rotate stored cells through use.
  - Recharge/re-store to voltage.
  - Remove any degraded cells from circulation.

## Doctrine Summary

> **"Every mission begins with a full cell and a clear purpose."**

- **Standardize** where possible to reduce friction, increase readiness.
- Each light gets at least one spare cell in the field.
- High-drain cells for tactical, high-CRI for medical/utility.
- No mystery cells. All brands vetted, all cells logged.
