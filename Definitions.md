# Convoy Doctrine – Definitions

This page defines the core categories in my flashlight doctrine. These aren't just roles — they're philosophies of use, battery pairings, UI choices, and mechanical expectations. Each category aligns with a specific mission, behavior, or deployment strategy.

## EDC Lights

**Definition:**  
Everyday Carry (EDC) lights are small, pocket-friendly tools designed for general purpose use. They prioritize convenience, low-profile carry, and rapid deployment for short-to-medium runtime tasks.

**Typical Characteristics:**
- **Cell:** 14500 or 18350 (rarely 18650 in small hosts)
- **Output Range:** ~0.5 to ~1000 lumens
- **Usage Style:** High mode often used in short bursts; turbo limited by thermal ramp-down or voltage sag.
- **Switching:** Often reverse-clicky or e-switch, sometimes forward clicky.
- **Optics:** Floody or medium beam profile.
- **Carry:** Pocket clip, jeans-friendly; often disappears in the hand.

**Example Role:**  
Stays in your pocket or bag. Used for walking the dog, checking locks, or finding a dropped screw in the dark.

## Tactical Lights

**Definition:**  
Lights built for rapid deployment under pressure. Tactical lights favor simplicity, mechanical reliability, and performance under duress. They are "staged tools" — a flashlight you *set* before you *use* it.

**Typical Characteristics:**
- **Cell:** 18650 or 21700
- **Output Range:** 1 to 2000+ lumens
- **Usage Style:** Medium to high outputs with **memory** enabled, so a chosen brightness can be pre-staged.
- **Switching:** Always forward-clicky for momentary control.
- **Optics:** Medium to throw-focused reflector (SFT40, SST40, etc.)
- **Carry:** Belt, bag, or vehicle-based; larger than EDC lights.

**Example Role:**  
Pre-staged to 100% mode for a search. Momentary on at 5% for signaling. Stays in your hand, pouch, or pack, ready to deploy under stress.

## Utility Lights

**Definition:**  
Practical work lights with hands-free features, versatile emitters, and often a right-angle format. These lights excel in repair, inspection, and work environments where mounting, clipping, or magnetics matter more than range.

**Typical Characteristics:**
- **Cell:** 18650 or 21700
- **Output Range:** 1 to 1500 lumens, often with good low modes.
- **Usage Style:** Continuous runtime, efficient drivers, usable modes.
- **Switching:** E-switch or reverse-clicky; memory optional.
- **Features:** Magnetic tail, clip, headlamp compatibility.
- **Emitters:** Often high CRI for color-sensitive tasks.

**Example Role:**  
Sticks to the hood of a car or clips onto a work shirt. Lives on a workbench or toolbelt. Gets dirty, gets dropped, and keeps going.

## Specialty Lights

**Definition:**  
Special-purpose builds that focus on a specific spectrum, emitter property, or unique mission. Can be built on any host paradigm (EDC, Tactical, Utility) but are defined by their non-white output or niche behavior.

**Typical Characteristics:**
- **Emitters:** Deep red, green, blue, UV (365nm), IR (850/940nm)
- **Cell:** Varies by host
- **Usage Style:** Role-specific. Output tuned to need, not general use.
- **Optics:** Often mule (no optic) or floody for close-up effect.
- **Usage Notes:** Some may require eye protection (UV) or have regulatory considerations (IR).

**Example Role:**  
- Red for preserving night vision during stargazing.
- UV for leak detection or mineral hunting.
- IR for use with night vision optics or cameras.

## Notes on Terminology

- **Forward Clicky** – Switch allows momentary operation before clicking fully. Tactical standard.
- **Memory Mode** – Remembers last used mode across power cycles. Useful for pre-staging.
- **Mode Group** – Customizable UI profiles offered by Convoy drivers. Enables tailoring light behavior to the role.
- **Turbo** – Max power output; often unsustainable for long durations due to heat.

*These definitions evolve as my builds and doctrine do. Use them as reference points — not rules — to guide your own light setup strategy.*
