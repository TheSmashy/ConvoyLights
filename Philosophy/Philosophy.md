# 🔦 Convoy Doctrine: Philosophy of Light

This document explains the principles behind my flashlight builds, preferences, and component choices. It's not just about what's in the light — it's about *why* it’s there.

This isn't universal advice — this is *my doctrine*.

## 🔋 Battery First

Power determines form, runtime, heat, and even LED compatibility. I pick batteries first, based on use case and size constraints.

See [`battery.md`](./battery.md) for deep notes on 18350 vs 18650, cell choice (H10 vs M11 vs 30Q), and storage practices.

## 🌡️ Color Temperature: The 4500K Rule

Most of my lights fall between **4000K–5000K**, with 4500K being the sweet spot.

**Why 4500K?**
- Enough warmth to be comfortable at night
- Still feels “neutral white” to the average eye
- Tints well with 219B, 519A, B35AM without major color shift
- Avoids the harshness of 5700K+ but keeps more clarity than 3000K

I build a few 3500K or 2700K lights, but those are niche tools — not daily drivers.

## 🔬 CRI > Lumens (Most of the Time)

If I can't see colors correctly, it doesn’t matter how bright the hotspot is.

**Why I prefer high-CRI emitters:**
- Better rendering of natural materials (wood, skin, foliage)
- Easier on the eyes during prolonged use
- Makes low lumen levels more useful

This is why so many of my builds use:
- **219B**
- **519A**
- **B35AM**

I only use SST40, SFT40, or CSLNM1 when I’m building for **throw** or **tactical flood** — not for general use.

## 🧠 EDC Philosophy

Lights must be:
- Comfortable in the pocket (18350 or small 18650 hosts)
- Ready at all times (no lockout headaches)
- Easy to operate with gloves or in the dark

So I prefer:
- **Forward or reverse clickies** with simple modes
- **TIR optics** or **OP reflectors** to smooth the beam
- **Deep carry clips** that don’t suck

---

## 💡 Optic Discipline

I match optics to use case:

| Optic Type | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| Bead TIR (20°) | Daily EDC, indoor work, close flood |
| Clear TIR | Max output flood, when hotspot isn't needed |
| OP Reflector | Outdoor walking light, soft throw |
| Mule (no optic) | Color inspection, tent light, close-up work |

---

## 🛠️ Host Preference

I use mostly **Convoy hosts** because they’re:
- Modular and predictable
- Durable
- Easy to mod
- Affordable enough to experiment

**S2+**, **S21D**, **M21B**, and **T3** are recurring platforms for a reason.

---

## 🧱 Build Roles

Each light gets a job — no shelf queens. If I build it, it gets used:

- **S2+ shorty flood** – indoor, pocket, backup
- **M21B thrower** – perimeter light, yard check
- **S21D quad** – general search
- **T3 mule** – desk, map reading, tent
- **S15** – in-pocket flood with style

## 🧠 Final Thought

I'm not trying to optimize for numbers — I'm optimizing for *experience*.  
I carry what I love, not just what charts best.
